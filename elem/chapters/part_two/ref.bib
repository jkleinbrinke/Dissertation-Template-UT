abstract="Activity recognition methods using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) have been actively studied in the mobile and ubiquitous computing community. Many prior studies on CSI-based context recognition systems employ CSI data collected at a high and constant sampling rate, resulting in always high computation costs for context recognition. In this study, we propose a CSI-based activity recognition method that adaptively adjusts the sampling rate using reinforcement learning. In the proposed method, the ``action'' in the reinforcement learning is defined as the selection of a sampling rate of CSI, and the ``state'' is defined as an intermediate output of a neural network for activity recognition in the environment, which is expected to include information describing the complexity of the current activity. Moreover, we design an activity recognition model that can accept CSI inputs collected at an arbitrary sampling rate in principle, and extract sampling-rate-independent intermediate representations in its intermediate layers, enabling the reinforcement learning agent to switch to an appropriate sampling rate regardless of the current sampling rate. We evaluated the proposed approach using data collected in real environments.",

@article{WiStep,
	abstract = {<p>Inspired by the emerging WiFi-based applications, in this paper, we leverage ubiquitous WiFi signals and propose a device-free step counting system, called WiStep. Based on the multipath propagation model, when a person is walking, her torso and limbs move at different speeds, which modulates wireless signals to the propagation paths with different lengths and thus introduces different frequency components into the received Channel State Information (CSI). To count walking steps, we first utilize time-frequency analysis techniques to segment and recognize the walking movement, and then dynamically select the sensitive subcarriers with largest amplitude variances from multiple CSI streams. Wavelet decomposition is applied to extract the detail coefficients corresponding to the frequencies induced by feet or legs, and compress the data so as to improve computing speed. Short-time energy of the coefficients is then calculated as the metric for step counting. Finally, we combine the results derived from the selected subcarriers to produce a reliable step count estimation. In contrast to counting steps based on the torso frequency analysis, WiStep can count the steps of in-place walking even when the person's torso speed is null. We implement WiStep on commodity WiFi devices in two different indoor scenarios, and various influence factors are taken into consideration when evaluating the performance of WiStep. The experimental results demonstrate that WiStep can realize overall step counting accuracies of 90.2% and 87.59% respectively in these two scenarios, and it is resilient to the change of scenarios.</p>},

	abstract = {WiFi has recently established itself as a powerful medium for radio frequency (RF) sensing due to its low cost and convenience. Many tasks, such as gesture recognition, activity recognition, and fall detection, can be implemented by measuring and calculating how the propagation of WiFi signals is affected by human activities. However, current WiFi-based sensing solutions have limited scales as they are designed for only a few activities and need to collect data and create training models in the same domain because the model established in a deployment environment is usually not applicable to new objects in the target domain. This paper presents TransferSense, an environment independent and one-shot WiFi sensing method based on deep learning. Firstly, amplitude and phase information of channel state information (CSI) are combined to increase the number of features to solve the problem of insufficient features due to single-source information. Secondly, TransferSense converts RF sensing tasks to image classification tasks and fuses low-level and high-level semantic features extracted from a pre-trained convolutional neural network to achieve an end-to-end high-precision sensing for activity recognition. Finally, TransferSense applies a transfer learning method with a small number of labeled samples in the target domain to perform high-precision cross-domain sensing, which can reduce the data collection cost in the target domain. We verified the effectiveness of TransferSense using two representative WiFi sensing applications, gait identification and sign recognition. In a single deployment environment, TransferSense achieved more than 97% human gait identification accuracy for 44 users and more than 81\% sign language recognition for 100 isolated sign language words. In the case of new object recognition in the cross-domain sensing, TransferSense achieved more than 77% human gait identification accuracy for 10 new users, more than 88\% sign language recognition for 10 new isolated sign language words, and more than 81\% gesture identification for 2 new gestures.},

Localisation of activities can assist in developing advanced healthcare systems able to identify the location of patients. Radio frequencies have been shown in numerous studies as a non-invasive method to identify human activity. This is achieved by observing the signal propagation described in the Channel State Information (CSI). This paper presents experimental results using Universal Software-Defined Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices to identify and localise a single human subject performing activities by utilizing the CSI of radio frequencies. The experiments are carried out to retrieve CSI samples observing a single subject perform no-activity, sitting, standing, and leaning forward actions in various positions in a room. Additional CSI is captured for the subject walking in two directions across the observed area. Giving a total of 6 activities spanning the monitored area. CSI is also collected while the monitored area is empty for further comparison. Artificial intelligence is used to make classifications on collected CSI. The proposed approach uses a Super Learner (SL) algorithm that can identify the location of different activities with 96% accuracy, outperforming existing benchmark approaches.},

	abstract = {Human activity recognition (HAR) based on channel state information (CSI) plays an increasingly important role in the research of human-computer interaction. Many CSI HAR models based on traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods have encountered two challenges. A lot of CSI activity data is needed to train the HAR models, which is time consuming. When the indoor environment or scene changes, the recognition accuracy of the model drops significantly, so it is necessary to recollect data to train the model. The existing few-shot learning-based method can solve the above problems to some extent, but when there are more kinds of new activities or fewer shots, the recognition accuracy will decrease significantly. In this article, considering the relationship between various activity data, a graph-based few-shot learning method with dual attention mechanism (CSI-GDAM) is proposed to perform CSI-based HAR. The model uses a feature extraction layer, including the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), to extract activity-related information in CSI data. The difference and inner product of the feature vector of the CSI activity samples are used to realize the graph convolutional network with a graph attention mechanism. The experiments proved that under the learning task of recognizing new activities in the new environment, the recognition accuracy rates reached 99.74% and 98.42% in the 5-way 5-shot and 5-way 1-shot cases, respectively. The proposed method is also compared with other few-shot learning and transfer learning methods.},

	abstract = {Activity recognition based on channel state information (CSI) plays an increasingly important role in human computer interaction. However most CSI activity recognition systems need to re-collect a large amount of samples and retrain model when they are used in new environments or recognize new types of activities, which greatly reduces the practicality of CSI activity recognition. To address this problem we design an adaptable CSI activity recognition system based on meta-learning, which only needs to fine-tune model with very little train effort when it is used in new environments or recognize new types of activities. Specifically, we first use meta-learning algorithm to get the pre-trained model that adapts to task distribution, when the environment or activity category changes, our system doesn't need to retrain the model and has maximal performance after updates the pre-trained model through one or more gradient steps computed with a small amount of samples from new activities. To prevent the loss of CSI time information after feature extraction with multi-layer CNN, we add time encoding on CSI data as the input of CNN neural network. Considering that CSI data may be labeled incorrectly during labeling process, we improve categorical cross entropy loss(CCE) to enhance the system's robustness to these mislabeled data. We test our system on the gesture dataset and the body activity dataset, and the experimental results show that our system achieves average accuracy of 72 percent with one sample of each new activity and 89.6 percent with five samples of each new activity.},

	abstract = {With the widespread of commercial communication equipment, WiFi signals are ubiquitous in human life. Therefore, utilizing WiFi signals to implement intelligent sensing applications is an inevitable trend. In WiFi sensing applications, through-the-wall crowd counting is a challenging problem. In the through-the-wall scenario, the wireless signal transmitted through the wall will carry a lot of noises and is severely attenuated. Therefore, the influence of human activities on the wireless signal is difficult to extract. To solve this problem, we propose TWCC, a through-the-wall crowd counting system using ambient WiFi signals. TWCC utilizes commercial WiFi equipments to extract the phase difference data of the channel state information (CSI) and transform it to sense the environment. First, TWCC preprocesses the data to remove uncorrelated noise, and then combines the sub-carrier correlation to achieve through-the-wall human detection. When people exist, TWCC extracts features from four domains as feature groups, namely time domain, subcarrier domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain. Then TWCC uses different backpropagation (BP) neural networks for the features of the four domains and combines with weighting and threshold judgment to realize the through-the-wall crowd counting detection. Extensive real-world experiments show that TWCC achieves an average recognition accuracy of about 90% and maintains strong robustness to different speeds and environments.},

	abstract = {In recent years, channel state information (CSI) in WiFi 802.11n has been increasingly used to collect data pertaining to human activity. Such raw data are then used to enhance human activity recognition. Activities such as lying down, falling, walking, running, sitting down, and standing up can now be detected with the use of information collected through CSI. Human activity recognition has a multitude of applications, such as home monitoring of patients. Four deep learning models are presented in this paper, namely: a convolution neural network (CNN) with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU); a CNN with a GRU and attention; a CNN with a GRU and a second CNN, and a CNN with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a second CNN. Those models were trained to perform Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using CSI amplitude data collected by a CSI tool. Experiments conducted to test the efficacy of these models showed superior results compared with other recent approaches. This enhanced performance of our models may be attributable the ability of our models to make full use of available data and to extract all data features, including high dimensionality and time sequence. The highest average recognition accuracy reached by the proposed models was achieved by the CNN-GRU, and the CNN-GRU with attention models, standing at 99.31% and 99.16%, respectively. In addition, the performance of the models was evaluated for unseen CSI data by training our models using a random split-of-dataset method (70% training and 30% testing). Our models achieved impressive results with accuracies reaching 100% for nearly all activities. For the lying down activity, accuracy obtained from the CNN-GRU model stood at 99.46%; slightly higher than the 99.05% achieved by the CNN-GRU with attention model. This confirmed the robustness of our models against environmental changes.},

	abstract = {<p>A human activity recognition (HAR) system acts as the backbone of many human-centric applications, such as active assisted living and in-home monitoring for elderly and physically impaired people. Although existing Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition methods report good results, their performance is affected by the changes in the ambient environment. In this work, we present Wi-Sense—a human activity recognition system that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize human activities based on the environment-independent fingerprints extracted from the Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI). First, Wi-Sense captures the CSI by using a standard Wi-Fi network interface card. Wi-Sense applies the CSI ratio method to reduce the noise and the impact of the phase offset. In addition, it applies the principal component analysis to remove redundant information. This step not only reduces the data dimension but also removes the environmental impact. Thereafter, we compute the processed data spectrogram which reveals environment-independent time-variant micro-Doppler fingerprints of the performed activity. We use these spectrogram images to train a CNN. We evaluate our approach by using a human activity data set collected from nine volunteers in an indoor environment. Our results show that Wi-Sense can recognize these activities with an overall accuracy of 97.78%. To stress on the applicability of the proposed Wi-Sense system, we provide an overview of the standards involved in the health information systems and systematically describe how Wi-Sense HAR system can be integrated into the eHealth infrastructure.</p>},

Many technologies that include surveillance cameras and wearable devices using sensors were proposed for human activity detection. But, these technologies are not popular due to a lack of convenience, privacy, availability, and affordability. Sensing and recognizing various human activities using wireless signal characteristics have been in the reckoning in recent years. This paper proposes a multi-stage deep learning model consisting of a convolutional neural network and other popular deep neural architectures, namely Alexnet, Googlenet, and Squeezenet, for Wi-Fi sensing-based human activity recognition. Transfer learning is used for recognizing crucial human activities using the channel state information (CSI) of the Wi-Fi signal. The objective is to identify critical human activities and then to minimize the false negatives. In the proposed multi-stage model, a data sample is tested in one network for identifying the critical activity; if classified as negative with predefined confidence, the sample is tested again in the subsequent architectures. A sample is considered negative only if all the stages confirm it as negative. Our proposed multi-stage model can reduce the false negatives with a slight increase in the false positive rate. We have considered the dataset consisting of measured CSI values of three transmitter–receiver pairs for six different activities: fall, wave, jump, walk, clap, and sit. We report the results of the experiments with a focus on reducing false negatives of individual activities during the testing phase.},

	abstract = {Human activity recognition (HAR) is an important task in many applications such as smart homes, sports analysis, healthcare services, etc. Popular modalities for human activity recognition involving computer vision and inertial sensors are in the literature for solving HAR, however, they face serious limitations with respect to different illumination, background, clutter, obtrusiveness, and other factors. In recent years, WiFi channel state information (CSI) based activity recognition is gaining momentum due to its many advantages including easy deployability, and cost-effectiveness. This work proposes CSITime, a modified InceptionTime network architecture, a generic architecture for CSI-based human activity recognition. We perceive CSI activity recognition as a multi-variate time series problem. The methodology of CSITime is threefold. First, we pre-process CSI signals followed by data augmentation using two label-mixing strategies — mixup and cutmix to enhance the neural network's learning. Second, in the basic block of CSITime, features from multiple convolutional kernels are concatenated and passed through a self-attention layer followed by a fully connected layer with Mish activation. CSITime network consists of six such blocks followed by a global average pooling layer and a final fully connected layer for the final classification. Third, in the training of the neural network, instead of adopting general training procedures such as early stopping, we use one-cycle policy and cosine annealing to monitor the learning rate. The proposed model has been tested on publicly available benchmark datasets, i.e., ARIL, StanWiFi, and SignFi datasets. The proposed CSITime has achieved accuracy of 98.20%, 98%, and 95.42% on ARIL, StanWiFi, and SignFi datasets, respectively, for WiFi-based activity recognition. This is an improvement on state-of-the-art accuracies by 3.3%, 0.67%, and 0.82% on ARIL, StanWiFi, and SignFi datasets, respectively. In lab-5 users’ scenario of the SignFi dataset, which has the training and testing data from different distributions, our model achieved accuracy was 2.17% higher than state-of-the-art, which shows the comparative robustness of our model.},

To meet future needs, multi-subject activity monitoring is in demand, whether it is for smart care centres or homes.

The ensemble technique can recognise a wide range of activity based on alterations in the wireless signal’s Channel State Information (CSI). The proposed system operates at 3.75 GHz, and up to four subjects participated in the experimental study in order to acquire data on sixteen distinct daily living activities: sitting, standing, and walking. The proposed methodology merges subject count and performed activities, resulting in occupancy count and activity performed being recognised at the same time. To capture alterations owing to concurrent multi-subject motions, the CSI amplitudes collected from 51 subcarriers of the wireless signals were processed and merged. To distinguish multi-subject activity, a machine learning model based on an ensemble learning technique was designed and trained using the acquired CSI data. For maximum activity classes, the proposed approach attained a high average accuracy of up to 98%. The presented system has the ability to fulfil prospective health activity monitoring demands and is a viable solution towards well-being tracking.</p>},

In the second phase, we extract 17 time-and frequency-domain features from the computed principal components obtained from the first phase. Furthermore, the minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm is applied to select a subset of the extracted features. Finally, in the third phase, we use the selected features to build a set of support vector machine classifiers to recognize the performed two-human interactions.

We propose a CSI correlation feature extraction (CCFE) method to improve and condense the activity-related information in input signals. It can also significantly reduce the computational complexity by decreasing the dimensions of input signals. We also propose novel training strategy which effectively utilizes the data set from the previously seen environments (PSE). In the least, the strategy can effectively realize human activity recognition using only one sample for each activity from the testing environment and the data set from one PSE. Numerous experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate that our proposed scheme significantly outperforms state-of-the-art HAR methods, achieving higher recognition accuracy and less training time.},

However, cross-scene activity recognition is still difficult due to the different distribution of samples in different scenes. To solve this problem, we try to build a cross-scene activity recognition system based on commercial WiFi. Firstly, we use commercial WiFi devices to collect channel state information (CSI) data and use the Bi-directional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network to train the activity recognition model. Then, we use the transfer learning mechanism to transfer the model to fit another scene. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of our system, and the experimental results verify the accuracy and robustness of our proposed system. For the source scene, the accuracy of the model trained from scratch can achieve over 90%. After transfer learning, the accuracy of cross-scene activity recognition in the target scene can still reach 90%.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensing represented by WiFi channel state information (CSI) is now enabling various fields of applications such as person identification, human activity recognition, occupancy detection, localization, and crowd estimation these days. So far, those fields are mostly considered as separate topics in WiFi CSI-based methods, on the contrary, some camera and vision-based crowd estimation systems intuitively estimate both crowd size and location at the same time. Our work is inspired by the idea that WiFi CSI also may be able to perform the same as the camera does. In this paper, we construct Wi-CaL, a simultaneous crowd counting and localization system by using ESP32 modules for WiFi links. We extract several features that contribute to dynamic state (moving crowd) and static state (location of the crowd) from the CSI bundles, then assess our system by both conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). As a result of ML-based evaluation, we achieved 0.35 median absolute error (MAE) of counting and 91.4% of localization accuracy with five people in a small-sized room, and 0.41 MAE of counting and 98.1% of localization accuracy with 10 people in a medium-sized room, by leave-one-session-out cross-validation. We compared our result with percentage of non-zero elements metric (PEM), which is a state-of-the-art metric for crowd counting, and confirmed that our system shows higher performance (0.41 MAE, 81.8% of within-1-person error) than PEM (0.62 MAE, 66.5% of within-1-person error).},

Wearable sensors have become more ubiquitous, and most of the wearable sensor data contain rich temporal structural information that describes the distinct underlying patterns and relationships of various activity types. The nature of those activities is typically sequential, with each subsequent activity window being the result of the preceding activity window. However, the state-of-the-art methods usually model the temporal characteristic of the sensor data and ignore the relationship of the sliding window. This research proposes a novel deep temporal Conv-LSTM architecture to enhance activity recognition performance by utilizing both temporal characteristics from sensor data and the relationship of sliding windows. The proposed architecture is evaluated based on the dataset consisting of transition activities—Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities and Postural Transitions dataset. The proposed hybrid architecture with parallel features learning pipelines has demonstrated the ability to model the temporal relationship of the activity windows where the transition of activities is captured accurately. Besides that, the size of sliding windows is studied, and it has shown that the selection of window size is affecting the accuracy of the activity recognition. The proposed deep temporal Conv-LSTM architecture can achieve an accuracy score of 0.916, which outperformed the state-of-the-art accuracy.},

In this paper, by using the channel state information (CSI) of the WiFi signal, semi-supervised transfer learning with dynamic associate domain adaptation is proposed for human activity recognition. In order to improve the CSI quality and denoising of CSI, we carried out missing packet filling, burst noise removal, background estimation, feature extraction, feature enhancement, and data augmentation in the data pre-processing stage. This paper considers the problem of environment-independent human activity recognition, also known as domain adaptation. The pre-trained model is trained from the source domain by collecting a complete labeled dataset of all of the CSI of human activity patterns. Then, the pre-trained model is transferred to the target environment through the semi-supervised transfer learning stage. Therefore, when humans move to different target domains, a partial labeled dataset of the target domain is required for fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a dynamic associate domain adaptation called DADA. By modifying the existing associate domain adaptation algorithm, the target domain can provide a dynamic ratio of labeled dataset/unlabeled dataset, while the existing associate domain adaptation algorithm only allows target domains with the unlabeled dataset. The advantage of DADA is that it provides a dynamic strategy to eliminate different effects on different environments. In addition, we further designed an attention-based DenseNet model, or AD, as our training network, which is modified by an existing DenseNet by adding the attention function. The solution we proposed was simplified to DADA-AD throughout the paper. The experimental results show that for domain adaptation in different domains, the accuracy of human activity recognition of the DADA-AD scheme is 97.4%.

There has been tremendous work on human activity recognition based on WiFi channel state information (CSI). Although achieving reasonable performance in certain cases, they are yet faced with a major challenge: location dependence. An activity recognition model trained at one location does not perform properly at other locations, because the human location also has significant influence on WiFi signal propagation. In this paper, we aim to solve the location dependence problem of CSI-based human activity recognition and propose a device-free cross location activity recognition (CLAR) method via semi-supervised deep learning. We regard the locations with labeled activity samples as the source domains and the locations with unlabeled activity samples as the target domains. By exploiting pseudo labeling and feature mapping, CLAR trains an activity recognition model working across the source and the target domains as well as the unseen domains which have no training samples. CLAR first extracts the trend component from the activity samples by Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), then annotates the unlabeled samples with the pseudo labels through a dual-score multi-classifier labeling model. The activity recognition model is trained using the labeled samples from the source domains and the pseudo-labeled samples from the target domains. Both the labeling and the recognition models are based on Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BLSTM). Evaluations in real-world environments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the method CLAR, which performs well for both the source and the target domains, and generalizes well to the unseen domains.},

In this article, we propose a multimodal channel state information-based activity recognition (MCBAR) system that leverages existing WiFi infrastructures and monitors human activities from CSI measurements. MCBAR aims to address the performances degradation of WiFi-based human recognition systems due to environmental dynamics. Specifically, we address the issue of nonuniformly distributed unlabeled data with rarely performed activities by taking advantages of the generative adversarial network (GAN) and semisupervised learning. We apply a multimodal generator to approximate the CSI data distribution in different environment settings with limited measured CSI data. The generated CSI data using the multimodal generator can provide better diversity for knowledge transfer. This multimodal generator improves the ability of MCBAR to recognize specific activities with various CSI patterns caused by environmental dynamics. Compared to state-of-the-art CSI-based recognition systems, MCBAR is more robust as it is able to handle the nonuniformly distributed CSI data collected from a new environment setting. In addition, diverse generated data from the multimodal generator improves the stability of the system. We have tested MCBAR under multiple experimental settings at different places. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes environmental dynamics and outperforms existing HAR systems.},

In this regard, context recognition using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) data has gained popularity, and various techniques have been proposed that combine unobtrusive sensing and deep learning to accurately detect various contexts ranging from human activities to gestures. However, research has shown that the performance of these techniques significantly degrades due to change in various factors including sensing environment, data collection configuration, diversity of target subjects, and target learning task (e.g., activities, gestures, emotions, vital signs). This problem, generally known as the domain change problem, is typically addressed by collecting more data and learning the data distribution that covers multiple factors impacting the performance. However, activity recognition data collection is a very labor-intensive and time consuming task, and there are too many known and unknown factors impacting WiFi CSI signals.

	abstract = {<p>The unpredictable situation from the Coronavirus (COVID-19) globally and the severity of the third wave has resulted in the entire world being quarantined from one another again. Self-quarantine is the only existing solution to stop the spread of the virus when vaccination is under trials. Due to COVID-19, individuals may have difficulties in breathing and may experience cognitive impairment, which results in physical and psychological health issues. Healthcare professionals are doing their best to treat the patients at risk to their health. It is important to develop innovative solutions to provide non-contact and remote assistance to reduce the spread of the virus and to provide better care to patients. In addition, such assistance is important for elderly and those that are already sick in order to provide timely medical assistance and to reduce false alarm/visits to the hospitals. This research aims to provide an innovative solution by remotely monitoring vital signs such as breathing and other connected health during the quarantine. We develop an innovative solution for connected health using software-defined radio (SDR) technology and artificial intelligence (AI). The channel frequency response (CFR) is used to extract the fine-grained wireless channel state information (WCSI) by using the multi-carrier orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique. The design was validated by simulated channels by analyzing CFR for ideal, additive white gaussian noise (AWGN), fading, and dispersive channels. Finally, various breathing experiments are conducted and the results are illustrated as having classification accuracy of 99.3% for four different breathing patterns using machine learning algorithms. This platform allows medical professionals and caretakers to remotely monitor individuals in a non-contact manner. The developed platform is suitable for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 scenarios.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Past decades have witnessed the extension of the Wi-Fi signals as a useful tool sensing human activities. One common assumption behind it is that there is a one-to-one mapping between human activities and Wi-Fi received signal patterns. However, this assumption does not hold when the user conducts activities in different locations and orientations. Actually, the received signal patterns of the same activity would become inconsistent when the relative location and orientation of the user with respect to transceivers change, leading to unstable sensing performance. This problem is known as the position-dependent problem, hindering the actual deployment of Wi-Fi-based sensing applications. In this paper, to tackle this fundamental problem, we develop a new position-independent sensing strategy and use gesture recognition as an application example to demonstrate its effectiveness. The key idea is to shift our observation from the traditional transceiver view to the hand-oriented view, and extract features that are irrespective of position-specific factors. Following the strategy, we design a position-independent feature, denoted as Motion Navigation Primitive(MNP). MNP captures the pattern of moving direction changes of the hand, which shares consistent patterns when the user performs the same gesture with different position-specific factors. By analyzing the pattern of MNP, we convert gestures into sequences of strokes (e.g, line, arc and corner) which makes them easy to be recognized. We build a prototype WiFi gesture recognition system, i.e., WiGesture to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Experiments show that our system can outperform the start-of-arts significantly in different settings. Given its novelty and superiority, we believe the proposed method symbolizes a major step towards gesture recognition and would inspire other solutions to position-independent activity recognition in the future.</p>},

	abstract = {Nowadays, WiFi-based human activity recognition (HAR), as a key enabler of building smart home, has gained tremendous attention because of its superior properties such as privacy protection and low-cost deployment. Since each human motion within the signal coverage would cause different wireless channel disturbances, it is possible to identify and interpret these activity-induced signal changes for human behavior recognition. Although many approaches attempt to extract distinct patterns from WiFi measurements corresponding to user activities, the signals can be easily attenuated due to environmental variations in the real settings, so that their recognition accuracy may be severely deteriorated. In order to extract the key features in a more distinguished way, in this paper, we propose WiWave, a WiFi-based device-free HAR system leveraging wavelet integrated convolutional neural network (CNN). Instead of utilizing pooling operations, our proposed network has introduced discrete wavelet transform (DWT) into the convolutional architectures, which can combine the good time-frequency local characteristics of the wavelet transform with the self-learning ability of the neural network. Consequently, not only high-level features from low-frequency components can be obtained automatically, but also the the size of feature map can be reduced. The experiment results demonstrate that WiWave achieves average 94.87% accuracy for distinguishing ten actions in real-world home environment.},

Although recent works have made great progress for human activity recognition at multiple locations, most of them rely on high-resolution data, adequate training samples and large-scale networks to model human activities, which ignores serial floating-point operations on CPU-driven devices and memory consumption limitations. Therefore, to address above issue, this paper proposes a Lightweight Mobile Temporal Convolution Network (LM-TCN). On the one hand, the proposed approach uses the fully 1-D convolution framework to provide time-shift invariant inductive bias. On the other hand, the combination of invert bottleneck and gated mechanism optimizes the computational load of the conventional residual structure to prevent overfitting under few training samples. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of the proposed LM-TCN is 95.2% across all 24 predefined locations, which is 2.9% higher than the baseline TCN while the calculation cost is reduced to 6% of TCN. It is worth noting that only 10 samples and 15 subcarriers for each activity at each location are used for training.},

	abstract = {With the maturity of artificial intelligence algorithms, the recognition of human actions is gradually used to detect human body conditions and other directions. Human activities and the movement of objects change the multipath characteristics of the wireless channel, leading to changes in the channel state information (CSI). Aiming at the problems of poor flexibility and low accuracy of traditional user action recognition methods, a user action recognition method based on parallel convolutional neural network-bidirectional long short-term memory network (CNN-BiLSTM) is proposed. This method uses discrete wavelet transform to filter out the noise in the CSI action data, then extracts the amplitude characteristics of the CSI data, and finally uses a deep learning network to recognize the action. CNN can learn the spatial feature information of actions, while the BiLSTM network can learn information with complex temporal features. In the experiment, 7 actions of 5 people were collected and evaluated, including falling, picking up, walking, sitting, etc. By extracting the features of these actions and using the Softmax function to classify, the effect of user action recognition is achieved, with an average accuracy rate of 98.7%. The results are compared with a single CNN and a singal BiLSTM network respectively, indicating the parallel CNN-BiLSTM model has high classification accuracy, strong learning ability, and robustness under different users and multiple action categories.},

Existing researches use learning-based methods to obtain several features of activity data and then recognize human activities. As we know, propagation characteristics of WiFi signals are different for individuals under different place conditions even in the same environment. In this paper, we focus on how to weaken the accuracy differences among individuals on activity recognition and improve the robustness in one indoor environment. Based on this, we design a novel deep learning model called LCED which consists of one LSTM-based Encoder, features image presentation, and one CNN-based Decoder to weaken the accuracy differences among individuals on activity recognition. We first use a low-pass filter to remove high-frequency noise data in time-sequence signal data and design variance-based window method to determine the start and the end of time-sequence signal data corresponding to an activity. After that, we utilize the proposed LCED model to learn informative features space of activity data and improve the accuracy of sixteen activities. Experimental results show that the average accuracy of sixteen activities is high 95% and the accuracy differences among individuals on activity recognition averagely decreases by 3%.},

Apart from communication applications, the recent research in wireless technology has turned Wi-Fi into other exploration possibilities such as human activity recognition (HAR). HAR is a field of study that aims to predict motion and movement made by a person or even several people. There are numerous possibilities to use the Wi-Fi-based HAR solution for human-centric applications in intelligent surveillance, such as human fall detection in the health care sector or for elderly people nursing homes, smart homes for temperature control, a light control application, and motion detection applications. This paper’s focal point is to classify human activities such as EMPTY, LYING, SIT, SIT-DOWN, STAND, STAND-UP, WALK, and FALL with deep neural networks, such as long-term short memory (LSTM) and support vector machines (SVM). Special care was taken to address practical issues such as using available commodity hardware. Therefore, the open-source tool Nexmon was used for the channel state information (CSI) extraction on inexpensive hardware (Raspberry Pi 3B+, Pi 4B, and Asus RT-AC86U routers). We conducted three different types of experiments using different algorithms, which all demonstrated a similar accuracy in prediction for HAR with an accuracy between 97% and 99.7% (Raspberry Pi) and 96.2% and 100% (Asus RT-AC86U), for the best models, which is superior to previously published results.

Commercial Wi-Fi devices can provide a non-invasive, cost-effective and long-term respiration rate-monitoring scheme for home scenarios. However, previous studies show that the breathing depth and location may affect the detectability of respiratory signals. In this study, we leverage the variation of the Doppler spectral energy extracted from the channel state information (CSI) collected by Wi-Fi devices to track the chest displacement induced by respiration. First, the random phase is eliminated by phase-fitting method to obtain the complex CSI containing the Doppler shift. Then, the multipath decomposition of CSI is carried out to obtain the channel impulse response, which eliminates the interference phase of the time delay and retains the Doppler shift. The dynamic path units are also separate from the multipath, which overcomes the indoor multipath effect. Finally, we conduct a time–frequency analysis to dynamic units to accumulate Doppler spectral energy. Based on these ideas, we design a complete respiration rate-monitoring system to obtain the respiration rate by using the consistency between the Doppler energy change period and the respiratory cycle. We evaluate our system through extensive experiments in several typical home environments filled with multipath. Experimental results show that the errors of the three scenarios are approximate, the maximum error is less than 0.7 bpm, and the average errors are approximately 0.15 bpm. This result indicates that our scheme can achieve high precision respiration monitoring and has good anti-multipath ability compared with existing methods.</p>},

An individual's limb motions in the WiFi coverage area could interfere with wireless signal propagation, that manifested as unique patterns for activity recognition. Existing approaches though yielding reasonable performance in certain cases, are ignorant of two major challenges. The performed activities of the individual normally have inconsistent speed in different situations and time. Besides that the wireless signal reflected by human bodies normally carries substantial information that is specific to that subject. The activity recognition model trained on a certain individual may not work well when being applied to predict another individual's activities. Since only recording activities of limited subjects in a certain speed and scale, recent works commonly have a moderate amount of activity data for training the recognition model. The small-size data could often incur the overfitting issue that negative affect the traditional classification model. To address these challenges, we propose a WiFi-based human activity recognition system that synthesizes variant activities data through eight channel state information (CSI) transformation methods to mitigate the impact of activity inconsistency and subject-specific issues, and also design a novel deep-learning model that caters to the small-size WiFi activity data. We conduct extensive experiments and show synthetic data improve performance by up to 34.6% and our system achieves around 90% of accuracy with well robustness in adapting to small-size CSI data.},

The effect of sensor location and activity location within the space are assessed to study the independence of the proposed solution with respect to these factors.

Prior studies on activity recognition mostly differentiate human activities by classifying one complete series into an activity. However, these approaches require massive datasets to give accurate results in real-time scenarios, and the classification is in fact based on short-term activity samples instead of the complete activity series.

The recent trend in HAR research is to train classifiers on top of statistical or deep neural features extracted from channel state information (CSI) data. Unfortunately, existing methods only take into account the temporal-correlation within each CSI subcarrier, while ignoring the spatial-correlation between different subcarriers. This issue has not been fully exploited yet, resulting a limited performance. To address this issue, we propose WiAReS, a WiFi-based device-free activity recognition system that takes both temporal-correlation and spatial-correlation into account. WiAReS embarks on diversified deep ensemble methods 2̌for single-user activity recognition where one user performs a single activity at a given time. More specifically, it adopts convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically extract features from CSI measurements with the preservation of the locality of both spatial patterns and temporal patterns. To further improve recognition accuracy upon CNN-extracted features, we propose a novel ensemble architecture that fuses a multiple layer perception (MLP), a random forest (RF) and a support vector machine (SVM). Our system obtains the CSI data in PHY layer of off-the-shelf WiFi devices by installing Atheros-CSI-Tool on AR9590 based WiFi network interface cards (NICs). Comprehensive experiments have been conducted in three real environments with environmental variation to evaluate the performance of the proposed WiAReS. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed WiARes system significantly outperforms existing methods.},

	abstract = {Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is becoming increasingly important in smart homes and healthcare applications such as assisted-living and remote health monitoring. In this paper, we use Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and commodity WiFi systems for the passive sensing of human activities. These systems are based on a receiver-only radar network that detects reflections of ambient Radio-Frequency (RF) signals from humans in the form of Channel Impulse Response (CIR) and Channel State Information (CSI). An experiment was performed whereby the transmitter and receiver were separated by a fixed distance in a Line-of-Sight (LoS) setting. Five activities were performed in between them, namely, sitting, standing, lying down, standing from the floor and walking. We use the high-resolution CIRs provided by the UWB modules as features in machine and deep learning algorithms for classifying the activities. Experimental results show that a classification performance with an F1-score as high as 95.53% is achieved using processed UWB CIR data as features. Furthermore, we analysed the classification performance in the same physical layout using CSI data extracted from a dedicated WiFi Network Interface Card (NIC). In this case, maximum F1-scores of 92.24% and 80.89% are obtained when amplitude CSI data and spectrograms are used as features, respectively.},

Not only are traditional telecommunication facilities such as text messaging, audio and video calling, video download and upload, web browsing, and social networking being improved but also a wide range of sensors and devices in the “Internet of things,” such as “smart cities” and smart hospital applications are being adopted. Researchers are trying hard to ensure timely detection of various diseases anytime and anywhere. In this research, a portable and multifunctional software-defined radio (SDR) platform is designed to detect different activities of human life, in particular for the monitoring of health. The wireless channel state information (WCSI) in the presence of the human body is investigated to capture movements using different frequency bands and is the key idea of this work. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with 64 subcarriers and the magnitude and phase responses in the frequency domain are used to capture the WCSI of the activity. The design is validated through simulation and real-time experiments. However, it is widely accepted that simulation results fail to capture real-life situations. Extensive and repeated real-time experiments are carried out on the hardware platform to ensure that the activity is detected accurately. The results achieved by detecting hand motion activity ensure that the system is capable of detecting human body motions and vital signs.},

In this work, we present a data augmentation method called window slicing. By slicing the original data, we get multiple samples for one raw datum. As a result, the size of the data set can be increased. On the basis of the experiments performed on a public data set and our collected data set, we observe that the proposed method assists in improving the results. It is notable that, on the public data set, the activity recognition accuracy improves from 88.13% to 97.12%. Similarly, the recognition accuracy is also improved for the data set collected in this work. Although the proposed method is simple, it effectively enhances the recognition accuracy.

In this paper, we used wireless data to train, validate and test different machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify USRP data into normal, shallow and elevated breathing depending on the breathing rate. Although different ML models were developed using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Discriminant Analysis (DA), Naive Bayes (NB) and Decision Tree (DT) algorithms, however results showed KNN based model provided the highest accuracy for our data (91%) each time the trial was made. DT (71.131%), DA (59.72%) and NB (48.99%).

Meanwhile, considering finetuning network directly is impossible or easy to overfit with limited labeled target data, transfer learning based methods with domain adaptive layers are proposed to solve above problems but just aligning marginal distribution, which may lose massive fine-grained features. Based on this, we present an end-to-end deep subdomain adaptive network based activities recognition (DSANAR) using Channel State Information (CSI) that aligns marginal and matches conditional distribution simultaneously for more fine-grained features in each category of relevant subdomains based on a local maximum mean discrepancy (LMMD).

However, existing methods fail to capture individual heartbeat intervals, though it is the most useful information for health and emotion recognition. The fast Fourier transform with a long time window has been necessary to overcome the inherently low signal-amplitude of the heartbeat in CSI. In this study, we propose a time domain method to estimate heart rate variability (HRV) using commodity Wi-Fi devices. The proposed method combines two techniques: (1) denoising by CSI quotient model, and (2) signal selection based on a standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN) and averaging.

Although existing WiFi-based HAR systems achieve satisfactory performance in some instances, they are faced with a severe challenge that the impacts of ubiquitous Co-channel Interference (CCI) on WiFi signals are inevitable. This downgrades the performance of these HAR systems significantly. To address this challenge, we propose PhaseAnti, a novel WiFi-based HAR system to exploit the CCI-independent phase component, Nonlinear Phase Error Variation (NLPEV), of WiFi Channel State Information to cope with the negative effects of CCI. The stability of NLPEV data and the sensibility of this component to motions are rigorously analyzed. Furthermore, validated by extensive properly designed experiments, this phase component across subcarriers is invariant under various CCI scenarios while sufficiently distinct for different motions. Therefore, the NLPEV data can be used and processed effectively to perform HAR in CCI scenarios. Extensive experiments with various daily activities in different indoor rooms demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed PhaseAnti system under various CCI scenarios.},

Recently, besides network services, WiFi sensing is appealing in smart homes since it is device-free, cost-effective and privacy-preserving. Though numerous WiFi sensing methods have been developed, most of them only consider single smart home scenario. Without the connection of powerful cloud server and massive users, large-scale WiFi sensing is still difficult. In this paper, we firstly analyze and summarize these obstacles, and propose an efficient large-scale WiFi sensing framework, namely EfficientFi. The EfficientFi works with edge computing at WiFi APs and cloud computing at center servers. It consists of a novel deep neural network that can compress fine-grained WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) at edge, restore CSI at cloud, and perform sensing tasks simultaneously. A quantized auto-encoder and a joint classifier are designed to achieve these goals in an end-to-end fashion. To the best of our knowledge, the EfficientFi is the first IoT-cloud-enabled WiFi sensing framework that significantly reduces communication overhead while realizing sensing tasks accurately. We utilized human activity recognition and identification via WiFi sensing as two case studies, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the EfficientFi. The results show that it compresses CSI data from 1.368Mb/s to 0.768Kb/s with extremely low error of data reconstruction and achieves over 98% accuracy for human activity recognition.},

By extension, this is often used in the monitoring of (early-stage) dementia. Current technologies are based on either audiovisual or wearable technologies, both of which have practical limitations. The use of (NLOS) radio-frequency based human activity recognition could provide solutions here. This paper leverages the 802.11n channel state information to monitor different shower-related activities (e.g. washing head or body, brushing teeth, and dressing up) and the degree to which some of these can be monitored, as well estimating different water pressures used while showering for multiple locations in the apartment. Wavelet denoising is applied for filtering and a convolutional neural network is implemented for classification. Results imply that for coarse-grained activity recognition, an F1-score of 0.85 is achievable for certain classes, while for fine-grained this drops to 0.75. Water pressure estimation ranges from 0.75 to 0.85 between fine-grained and coarse-grained, respectively. Overall, this paper shows that channel state information can be successfully employed to monitor variations in different shower activities, as well as successfully estimating the water pressure in the shower.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Wi-Fi infrastructures have become ubiquitous, providing device-free passive-sensing features. Wi-Fi signals can be affected by their reflection, refraction, and absorption by moving objects in their path. The channel state information (CSI), a signal property indicator, of the Wi-Fi signal can be analyzed for human activity recognition (HAR). Deep learning-based HAR models can enhance performance and accuracy without sacrificing computational efficiency. However, to save computational power, an inception network, which uses a variety of techniques to boost speed and accuracy, can be adopted. In contrast, the concept of spatial attention can be applied to obtain refined features. In this paper, we propose a human-human interaction (HHI) classifier, CSI-IANet, which uses a modified inception CNN with a spatial-Attention mechanism. The CSI-IANet consists of three steps: i) data processing, ii) feature extraction, and iii) recognition. The data processing layer first uses the second-order Butterworth low-pass filter to denoise the CSI signal and then segment it before feeding it to the model. The feature extraction layer uses a multilayer modified inception CNN with an attention mechanism that uses spatial attention in an intense structure to extract features from captured CSI signals. Finally, the refined features are exploited by the recognition section to determine HHIs correctly. To validate the performance of the proposed CSI-IANet, a publicly available HHIs CSI dataset with a total of 4800 trials of 12 interactions was used. The performance of the proposed model was compared to those of existing state-of-The-Art methods. The experimental results show that CSI-IANet achieved an average accuracy of 91.30%, which is better than that of the existing best method by 5%.},

	abstract = {WiFi sensing using Channel State Information (CSI) offers a device-free and non-intrusive method for human activity monitoring. However, the data-hungry and location-specific training process hinders its scalable deployment at large sizes. In this work, we propose WiFederated, a federated learning (FL) approach to train machine learning models for WiFi sensing tasks. Using WiFederated, client devices can not only perform training in parallel at the edge instead of sequentially at a central server but can also collaboratively learn and share generalizable location-independent traits about physical actions being monitored. We demonstrate that an FL model trained on as few as 2-3 locations can provide high prediction accuracy in new locations even without any data available from them. We also demonstrate how new locations can achieve higher prediction accuracy even with a small number of available samples when using the pretrained FL model rather than training from scratch. The results show that the FL model can save local training epochs and reduce the need for large data collection at each new location. Thus, the proposed WiFederated system scales as more locations are added. We show that WiFederated provides a more accurate and time efficient solution compared to existing transfer learning and adversarial learning solutions thanks to the parallel training ability at multiple clients. By introducing new client selection methods during the FL process, we also show that accuracy can further increase. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of training models at the edge and introduce continuous annotation to allow for continuous learning over time.},

And besides, in order to improve the robustness of AFSL-HAR, we design a Feature Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (FWGAN) module, which can synthesize diverse samples to help the recognition model learn more sharper classification boundaries. Specifically, the FWGAN module incorporates a feature extractor to realize converging with a fewer number of training samples, and takes an improved discriminator to enhance system performance.

To this end, we take a careful look at the dynamics of WiFi signals under human respiration and body motions in the wild. We first characterize the WiFi signal components - multipath and signal subspace - that are modulated by human respiration and body motions. We extrapolate on a set of transformations, including first-order differentiation, max-min normalization and component projections, that faithfully explains and quantifies the dynamics of respiration and body motions on WiFi signals. Grounded in this characterization, we propose two methods: 1) a respiration tracking technique that models the peak dynamics observed in the time-varying signal subspace and 2) a body-motion tracking technique built with a multi-dimensional clustering of evolving signal subspace. Finally, we reflect on the manifestation of these techniques in a practical sleep monitoring application.},

However, such devices need to be worn by the patients all the time. These devices have limitations such as their battery lifetime, charging mechanism, and hardware-related cost. Moreover, these devices transmit a huge amount of redundant and inconsistent data. The transmitted data need to be fused to remove any outlier so that only highly- refined data are available for decision-making. In this paper, we use channel state information (CSI) to track the vital signs of a patient and remove any outliers from the gathered data. We monitor the respiration rate of a patient during sleep with minimal hardware-related cost. Our CSI-based approach no longer requires the patients to wear any wearables and can monitor even the minute fluctuations in a WiFi signal. For extracting useful features from the respiratory data, three types of feature extraction techniques are used. In order to select important features from the extracted feature space, three feature selection algorithms, i.e., Relief, mRMR, and Lasso, have been investigated. In addition, for predicting the health conditions of a patient, four machine learning classification algorithms, i.e., KNN, SVM, DT, and RF, are utilized. The use of CSI ensures that highly refined and fused data are available for feature selection, and the selected features are presented to the ML classification algorithms for predicting the health condition of the patient.},

First, the application of human activity classification as well as data preprocessing techniques are introduced in details, and then a fully connected network is developed as the baseline network model. Furthermore, the weight sharing technique is introduced with the similarity network structure, and a new hybrid loss containing the classification loss and similarity loss is proposed. Experiment results are also included and show that the proposed network can achieve higher classification accuracy than the baseline model.},

	abstract = {In this article, we recognize multiple human activities in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) network using differential channel state information (CSI) of the available wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) signals. Different human activities in the Wi-Fi environment lead to multipath fading, resulting in a change of CSI for each activity. This CSI is sensed by smart IoT devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops for activity recognition. The use of differential CSI mitigates the offset and background noise. Another advantage of the proposed method is that it eliminates the requirement of traditional wearable activity recognition sensors, such as gyroscope, pedometers, and accelerometers. A long short-term memory (LSTM) model is used for automatic feature extraction and classification of human activities from the differential CSI. Training the LSTM model with the phase of differential denoised CSI significantly improves the classification accuracy. The results show a good tradeoff between model complexity and classification accuracy, thereby ensuring better performance as compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {<p>With the advancement of wireless technologies and sensing methodologies, many studies have shown that wireless signals can sense human behaviors. Human activity recognition using channel state information (CSI) in commercial WiFi devices plays an important role in many applications. In this paper, a framework for human activity recognition was constructed based on WiFi CSI signal enhancement. Firstly, the sensitivity of different antennas to human activity was studied. An antenna selection algorithm was proposed, which can make a choice of the antenna automatically based on their sensitivity in accordance with different activities. Secondly, two signal enhancement approaches, which can strengthen the active signals and weaken the inactive signals, were proposed to extract the active interval caused by human activity. Finally, an activity segmentation algorithm was proposed to detect the start and end time of activity. In order to verify and evaluate the methods, extensive experiments have been conducted in real indoor environments. The experimental results have demonstrated that our solutions can eliminate a large number of redundant information brought by insensitive and inactive signals. Our research results can be put into use to improve recognition accuracy significantly and decrease the cost of recognition time.</p>},

With the development of sensing technology, various approaches have been proposed for occupancy monitoring indoors. However, such approaches have practical limitations that they require additional occupancy sensors, which may raise privacy issues and obtrude on occupants’ daily lives. In this research, a Wi-Fi-based occupancy monitoring system, Wi-Sensing, is proposed to recognize occupant's activities of daily living in a non-intrusive way by exploiting commercial off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices. Channel State Information (CSI) has been extracted from Wi-Fi signals collected from multiple Wi-Fi devices, which could be replaced by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. While multiple receivers are needed to cover the entirety of an indoor space, previous approaches have been proposed to extract numerous features from a single transmitter–receiver pair. In this context, this study presents a new approach toward extracting spatial–temporal features from multiple receivers deployed throughout an indoor space. In this approach, a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) was used to convert time-series CSI data into image data. The converted image data from each receiver was then integrated as large image data, which preserved the temporal-spatial information of all the receiver data. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used as a feature extractor for the image data, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was exploited to classify basic activities in daily life (e.g., personal hygiene, eating, mobility, etc.). Wi-Sensing provides over 96% classification accuracy in two different indoor environments.},

Human activity recognition without the use of any cooperative device such as phones or wearable technologies can be achieved by two WiFi based approaches: Channel State Information (CSI) and Passive WiFi Radar (PWR). CSI systems rely directly on WiFi as a communications system, whilst PWR treats the WiFi signal as an illuminator for use in a radar signal processing. However, there has not been a comprehensive comparative study on the similarities and differences between the two systems. To examine the performance of both systems we implement two hardware platforms for CSI and PWR, and use them concurrently to capture the human movements. In this paper, we present Doppler measurements from the two systems and compare their performance using a dataset obtained from five subjects undergoing six activity classes. It is observed that both systems have very different Doppler signatures, and are sensitive to the transmitter-target-receiver geometries. CSI has a better performance in Line-of-Sight (LoS) configurations, whereas PWR has better performance in bistatic configurations where the WiFi access point and radar receiver are spatially separated. It is envisioned that a more robust system should leverage strengths of both the CSI and PWR systems jointly to maximize their benefits in wireless sensing.},

However, a fundamental challenge is ensuring accuracy, without re-training, when exposing a previously trained architecture to a new or unseen environment. To overcome the aforementioned challenge, this paper proposes an environment-robust channel state information (CSI) based HAR by leveraging the properties of a matching network (MatNet) and enhanced features (HAR-MN-EF). To improve the CSI quality, we propose a CSI cleaning and enhancement method (CSI-CE) that includes two key stages: activity-related information extraction (ARIE) and correlation feature extraction based on principal component analysis (CFE-PCA). The ARIE stage is able to effectively enhance the activity-dependent features whilst mitigating behavior-unrelated information. The CFE-PCA stage further improves the extracted features by filtering out the residual activity-unrelated data and the residual noise contained in signals from the former stage. The extracted features are then sequenced into the MatNet to create an environment-robust HAR. Experimental results confirm that an architecture trained by the proposed HAR-MN-EF can be directly adapted to a new environment, achieving reliable sensing accuracies without requiring additional effort.},

As a kind of gesture, sign language is widely used in life. The establishment of an effective sign language recognition system can help people with aphasia and hearing impairment to better interact with the computer and facilitate their daily life. For this reason, this paper proposes a contactless fine-grained gesture recognition method using Channel State Information (CSI), namely Wi-SL. This method uses a commercial WiFi device to establish the correlation mapping between the amplitude and phase difference information of the subcarrier level in the wireless signal and the sign language action, without requiring the user to wear any device. We combine an efficient denoising method to filter environmental interference with an effective selection of optimal subcarriers to reduce the computational cost of the system. We also use K-means combined with a Bagging algorithm to optimize the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification (KSB) model to enhance the classification of sign language action data. We implemented the algorithms and evaluated them for three different scenarios. The experimental results show that the average accuracy of Wi-SL gesture recognition can reach 95.8%, which realizes device-free, non-invasive, high-precision sign language gesture recognition.</p>},

	abstract = {<p>Features extraction and analysis for human activity recognition (HAR) have been studied for decades in the 5th generation (5G) and beyond the 5th generation (B5G) era. Nowadays, with the extensive use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the civil field, integrating wireless signal receivers on UAVs could be a better choice to receive hearable signals more conveniently. In recent years, the HAR system based on CSI based on WiFi radar has received widespread attention due to its low cost and privacy protection property. However, in the existing CSI-based HAR system, there are two disadvantages: (1) The detection threshold is manually set, which limits its adaptability and immediacy in different wireless environments. (2) A sole classifier is used to complete the recognition, resulting in poor robustness and relatively low recognition accuracy. In this paper, we propose a CSI-based device-free HAR (CDHAR) system with WiFi-sensing radar integrated on UAVs to recognize everyday human activities. Firstly, by using machine learning, CDHAR applies kernel density estimation (KDE) to obtain adaptive detection thresholds to complete the extraction of activity duration. Second, we proposed a random subspace classifier ensemble method for classification, which applies the frequency domain feature instead of the time domain feature, and we choose each kind of feature in the same amount. Finally, we prototype CDHAR on commercial WiFi devices and evaluate its performance in both indoor environment and outdoor environments. The experiment results tell that even if experimental scenario varies, the accuracy of activity durations extraction can reach 98% and 99.60% whether in outdoor or indoor environments. According to the extracted data, the recognition accuracy in outdoor and indoor environments can reach 91.2% and 90.2%, respectively. CDHAR ensures high recognition accuracy while improving the adaptability and instantaneity.</p>},

Many recent studies explore this rich source of data to produce quite accurate results in device-free localization, human-body pose recognition, and device-free person identification under the umbrella of WiFi Sensing. Most works thus far rely on the use of the Intel 5300 Network Interface Card (NIC), a device requiring connection to a host computer to function. Because of this requirement, the weight and form factor of CSI recording capable devices (receiver or RX) has limited the abilities of researchers to explore certain aspects of WiFi sensing such as active repositioning and mobility of RX devices. To address this, in this paper, we use the ESP32 microcontroller to develop a simple and lightweight solution for CSI collection leveraging recent additions to the Espressif IoT Development Framework which allows user developed programs to access CSI directly. The system can work standalone or attached to a smartphone for advanced online computations. Thus, it can be easily deployed, repositioned, and carried on mobile objects, which can then help improve the performance of sensing tasks. We evaluate the performance of our proposed system through several deep-learning based human activity recognition experiments and show that the repositioning and mobility of RX devices can provide increases in accuracy upwards of 29.4% and 28.2%, respectively, compared to the commonly considered static RX scenario. Finally, we produce an easy to use open source codebase for researchers to immediately begin exploring the new possibilities (e.g., massive deployment) available by the usage of the proposed system.},

In this paper, we aim to tackle these problems by proposing a novel scheme for CSI-based HAR that uses activity filter-based deep learning network (HAR-AF-DLN) with enhanced correlation features.

Recently, some pioneer WiFi-based HAR systems have been proposed due to its privacy-friendly and device-free characteristics. However, their crucial limitation lies in ignoring the inevitable impact of co-channel interference (CCI), which degrades the performance of these HAR systems significantly. To address this challenge, we propose PhaseAnti, a novel HAR system to exploit the CCI- independent phase component, NLPEV (Nonlinear Phase Error Variation), of Channel State Information (CSI) to cope with the impact of CCI. We provide a rigorous analysis of NLPEV data with respect to its stability and otherness. Validated by our experiments, this phase component across subcarriers is invariant to various CCI scenarios, while different for distinct motions. Based on the analysis, we use NLPEV data to perform HAR in CCI scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhaseAnti can reliably recognize activity in various CCI scenarios. Specifically, PhaseAnti achieves a 95% recognition accuracy rate (RAR) on average, which improves up to 16% RAR in the presence of CCI. Moreover, the recognition speed is 9× faster than the state-of-the-art solution.},

However, the parameterssuch as operating frequency, transmitting power, and antenna design are static where each application requires particular hardware applications. This paper lays the foundation for ADLs and presents the design of the testbed based on Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) in conjunction with omni directional antenna, that can be used for detecting large scale body movements such as walking, sitting, standing, and critical events such as falls and small-scale movements. The core idea is to extract the channel state information (CSI) from the received signal since each body motion produces a unique CSI signature. In this context, we have performed various human activities such as walking, sitting on a chair etc. in indoor environment using two USRPs. The experimental results indicate that each body motion can be visually identified by examining the CSI data.},

	abstract = {Body movement is one of the most important indicators of sleep quality for elderly people living alone. Body movement is crucial for sleep staging and can be combined with other indicators, such as breathing and heart rate to monitor sleep quality. Nevertheless, traditional sleep monitoring methods are inconvenient and may invade users' privacy. To solve these problems, we propose a contactless body movement recognition (CBMR) method via WiFi signals. First, CBMR uses commercial off-the-shelf WiFi devices to collect channel state information (CSI) data of body movement and segment the CSI data by sliding window. Then, the context information of the segmented CSI data is learned by a bidirectional recurrent neural network (Bi-RNN). Bi-RNN can fuse the forward and backward propagation information at some point, and input it into a deeper independently recurrent neural network (IndRNN) with residual mechanism to extract the deeper features and capture the time dependencies of CSI data. Finally, the type of body movement can be recognized and classified by the softmax function. CBMR can effectively reduce data preprocessing and the delay caused by manually extracting features. The results of an experiment conducted on a complex body movement data set show that our method gives desirable performance and achieves an average accuracy of greater than 93.5%, which implies a prospect application of CBMR.},

	abstract = {Human activity recognition has been growing for decades in a variety of technological disciplines. However, in the existing WiFi-based human activity recognition systems, there are the following problems: Firstly, in the processing of channel state information (CSI) data, mainly for the removal of noise in the superimposed signal, there is no effective removal of useless multipath signals; Secondly, the data segmentation algorithm based on the empirical threshold requires manual adjustment of the threshold in different environments, resulting in poor robustness and unstable segmentation; Thirdly, simple learning classification is applied without specific design for CSI data structure and sufficiently abstracting information features. In this paper, a device-free human activity recognition system with a temporal-frequency attention mechanism is proposed, which can be deployed on commercial WiFi devices to identify human's daily activities. Firstly, the multipath signal affected by the channel change is extracted by using the difference of the propagation delay of different multipath, thereby eliminating the delay and invalid multipath signals that have undergone multiple reflections and refractions. Secondly, a neural network model based on attention mechanism is proposed, which assigns different weights to different characteristics and sequences by imitating the human brain to dedicate more attention to important information. Then, the long short-term memory (LSTM) model is used to learn the correlation features of different dimensions to realize human activity recognition. Finally, the system performance is evaluated in different environments, and the experimental results show that our syetem holds a better performance in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) than the existing human activity recognition systems.},

	abstract = {Channel state information (CSI)-based human activity recognition plays an essential role in various application domains, such as security, healthcare, and Internet of Things. Most existing CSI-based activity recognition approaches rely on manually designed features that are classified using traditional classification methods. Furthermore, the use of deep learning methods for CSI-based activity recognition is still at its infancy with most of the existing approaches focus on recognizing single-human activities. The current study explores the feasibility of utilizing deep learning methods to recognize human-to-human interactions (HHIs) using CSI signals. Particularly, we introduce an end-to-end deep learning framework that comprises three phases, which are the input, feature extraction, and recognition phases. The input phase converts the raw CSI signals into CSI images that comprise time, frequency, and spatial information. In the feature extraction phase, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to automatically extract deep features from the CSI images. Finally, the extracted features are fed to the recognition phase to identify the class of the HHI associated with each CSI image. The performance of our proposed framework is assessed using a publicly available CSI dataset that was acquired from 40 different pairs of subjects while performing 13 HHIs. Our proposed framework achieved an average recognition accuracy of 86.3% across all HHIs. Moreover, the experiments indicate that our proposed framework enabled significant improvements over the results achieved using three state-of-the-art pre-trained CNNs as well as the results obtained using four different conventional classifiers that employs traditional handcrafted features.},

	abstract = {<p> Human activity recognition (HAR) is a broad research area. While there exist solutions based on sensors and vision-based technologies, these solutions suffer from considerable limitations. Thus in order to mitigate or avoid these limitations, device free solutions based on radio signals like (home) WiFi, in particular 802.11 are considered. Recently, channel state information (CSI), available in WiFi 802.11n networks have been proposed for fine-grained analysis. We are able to detect human activities like <sc>Walk</sc> , <sc>Sit</sc> , <sc>Stand</sc> , <sc>Run</sc> (in the sequel, any human activity used for classification is capitalised, i.e. is denoted by its corresponding label. For example, “standing“ is denoted as <sc>Stand</sc> , the activity “sitting“ is denoted by <sc>Sit</sc> and so on), etc. in a line-of-sight (LOS) scenario and a non-line-of-sight (N-LOS) scenario within an indoor environment. We propose two algorithms—one using a support vector machine (SVM) for classification and another one using a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. While the former uses sophisticated pre-processing and feature extraction techniques based on wavelet analysis, the latter processes the raw data directly (after denoising). We show that it is possible to characterize activities and/or human body presence with high accuracy and we compare both approaches with regard to accuracy and performance. Furthermore, we extend the experimental setup to detect human falls, too which is a relevant use-case in the context of ambient assisted living (AAL) and show that with the developed algorithms it is possible to detect falls with high accuracy. In addition, we also show that the algorithms can be used to count the number of people in a room based on the CSI-data, which is a first step towards detecting more complex social behavior and activities. Our paper is an extended version of the paper (Damodaran and Schäfer, Device free human activity recognition using wifi channel state information, in: 16th IEEE International Conference on Ubiquitous Intelligence and Computing (UIC 2019), 5th IEEE Smart World Congress, Leicester, vol 16, IEEE, 2019). </p>},

	abstract = {Robust and accurate human activity recognition (HAR) systems are essential to many human-centric services within active assisted living and healthcare facilities. Traditional HAR systems mostly leverage a single sensing modality (e.g., either wearable, vision, or radio frequency sensing) combined with machine learning techniques to recognize human activities. Such unimodal HAR systems do not cope well with real-time changes in the environment. To overcome this limitation, new HAR systems that incorporate multiple sensing modalities are needed. Multiple diverse sensors can provide more accurate and complete information resulting in better recognition of the performed activities. This article presents WiWeHAR-a multimodal HAR system that uses combined Wi-Fi and wearable sensing modalities to simultaneously sense the performed activities. WiWeHAR makes use of standard Wi-Fi network interface cards to collect the channel state information (CSI) and a wearable inertial measurement unit (IMU) consisting of accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer sensors to collect the user's local body movements. We compute the time-variant mean Doppler shift (MDS) from the processed CSI data and magnitude from the inertial data for each sensor of the IMU. Thereafter, we separately extract various time- and frequency-domain features from the magnitude data and the MDS. We apply feature-level fusion to combine the extracted features, and finally supervised learning techniques are used to recognize the performed activities. We evaluate the performance ofWiWeHAR by using a multimodal human activity data set, which was obtained from 9 participants. Each participant carried out four activities, such as walking, falling, sitting, and picking up an object from the floor. Our results indicate that the proposed multimodalWiWeHAR system outperforms the unimodal CSI, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer HAR systems and achieves an overall recognition accuracy of 99.6%-100%.},

However, prior works usually recognize each individual activity by extracting the feature of corresponding WiFi signals, and hence distinguishing differences between human activities. Once the activity has multiple variations of different body parts (such as head, arm and leg), distinguishing such sub-activities is extremely difficult. In this paper, we propose a Multi-variations Activity Recognition (MAR) system to identify multiple-variations of body parts.

Firstly, CANDECOMP/ PARAFAC (CP) decomposition and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) are applied to recognize multi-variations activities. Secondly, we theoretically analyse the uniqueness of CP decomposition. Then, we design specific experiment to verify the reliability and stability of uniqueness. Finally, we apply MAR in gaits recognition of multiple volunteers to evaluate the accuracy performance.

One of the main approaches used in wireless sensing is based on fine-grained WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) which can be extracted from commercial Network Interface Cards (NICs).

An experiment involving five participants performing six different activities was carried out in an office space to evaluate the performance of activity recognition using WiFi CSI in different physical layouts. Experimental results show that the CSI system has the best detection performance when activities are performed half-way in between the transmitter and receiver in a line-of-sight (LoS) setting. In this case, an accuracy as high as 91% is achieved while the accuracy for the case where the transmitter and receiver are co-located is around 62%. As for the case when data from all layouts is combined, which better reflects the real-world scenario, the accuracy is around 67%. The results showed that the activity detection performance is dependent not only on the locations of the transmitter and receiver but also on the positioning of the person performing the activity.},

Recently, radio analytics has been proposed as a promising technique that exploits multipath as virtual antennas, extracts various features from wireless signals, and reveals rich environmental information. As automobiles continue to play an important role nowadays, manufacturers have been seeking emerging techniques for IoT applications that support drivers and enhance safety. The interior of an automobile can be viewed as a special indoor environment where most of the multipaths are restricted inside by the metal exterior. In this article, we introduce the concept of wireless artificial intelligence (AI) and demonstrate its concept in a smart car scenario where information about drivers and passengers is collected by commercial Wi-Fi devices deployed in the car. The proposed wireless AI system is capable of identifying authorized drivers based on radio biometric information. Vital signals of human introduce periodic patterns to the wireless CSI. By extracting the vital sign from wireless signals, the proposed wireless AI system can monitor the driver's state, count number of people in the car, and detect a child left in an unattended car.},

@article{SignFi,
	abstract = {<p>We propose SignFi to recognize sign language gestures using WiFi. SignFi uses Channel State Information (CSI) measured by WiFi packets as the input and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the classification algorithm. Existing WiFi-based sign gesture recognition technologies are tested on no more than 25 gestures that only involve hand and/or finger gestures. SignFi is able to recognize 276 sign gestures, which involve the head, arm, hand, and finger gestures, with high accuracy. SignFi collects CSI measurements to capture wireless signal characteristics of sign gestures. Raw CSI measurements are pre-processed to remove noises and recover CSI changes over sub-carriers and sampling time. Pre-processed CSI measurements are fed to a 9-layer CNN for sign gesture classification. We collect CSI traces and evaluate SignFi in the lab and home environments. There are 8,280 gesture instances, 5,520 from the lab and 2,760 from the home, for 276 sign gestures in total. For 5-fold cross validation using CSI traces of one user, the average recognition accuracy of SignFi is 98.01%, 98.91%, and 94.81% for the lab, home, and lab+home environment, respectively. We also run tests using CSI traces from 5 different users in the lab environment. The average recognition accuracy of SignFi is 86.66% for 7,500 instances of 150 sign gestures performed by 5 different users.</p>},

	abstract = {In our current society, unobtrusive sensing has become an important tool to monitor the physical world, as it is easy to use and privacy-aware. Remote sensing is a new and heavily researched technology based on the analysis of radio signals. A particular field research in this area is the analysis of channel state information with the raw signal, as this contains the most information. While most research focuses on analysis of individuals or clustered data, little to no research has gone into the analysis of channel state information of multiple people over multiple days for different and comparable activities. This dataset contains data of nine different participants over three different days, with an two participants repeating the activities over an additional three days. The dataset is available at the 4TU.ResearchData under the CC BY-NC-SA license [4].},
