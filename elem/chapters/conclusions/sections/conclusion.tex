As outlined in the introduction, this thesis is not meant to be read linearly; this first part should provide the reader with all information on the conducted research. As such, this chapter, \textit{Findings and Recommendations}, replaces the conventional \textit{Conclusion} chapter at the end of a thesis. It summarizes the conclusions at the end of each part and connects these, and potential other implications, to the research questions, hypotheses, and future work. This allows the reader to get a quick and early overview of the main work, contributions, and main findings. The reader is invited to focus on individual parts based on their interest rather than reading the entire book from front to back.
