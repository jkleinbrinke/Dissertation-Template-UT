Semi-template of the final version of my dissertation **Interwoven Waves: Enhancing the Scalability and Robustness of Wi-Fi Channel State Information for Human Activity Recognition** [link](https://doi.org/10.3990/1.9789036561419), doi: 10.3990/1.9789036561419 ].

This template was never meant to be shared, so there are no comments and there is a lot of 'duct taping' of code ;) However, due to popular demand, I decided to clean up the code and share the barebone template.
